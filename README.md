# Qvi
QuasiVectorInferhirent
 aside from standard variateable frequency 
 distribution of vectored glyphs. QVI aims at 
 a perpendicular subset of frequency 
 modulation which is overlooked, the range of 
 highly premeditated integral over/under-
 modulated curve fitted glyph sets dynamically 
 derived(although time consuming).
